        <h1>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h1>
        <ol className='terms-conditions'>
         <h4><li>Introduction</li></h4>
          <p className='text-justify'>Terms and Conditions are set to be part of the travel contract requesting the traveler to thoroughly read it prior to signature which entails his or her confirmation. The purchase of the travel package confirms his or her acceptance and is bound to acknowledge the present terms and conditions after having it signed. 

            <br /> <br />

            The guest/traveler can request any itineraries that can be tailor-made fitting his or her wish. A response to that will be done within three working days. Both parties (the tour company and the traveler) will be working on how to better the tour that the traveler wants whether to shorten or lengthen it until final itineraries are agreed by both parties. 

            <br /> <br />
            Then, the guest is encouraged to provide to us his or her international arrival and departure date so that we can proceed on fitting all bookings of his or her trip. Upon agreement of the final itinerary, the traveler will be requested to sign a contract and then send it back to us.

            <br /> <br />
            Besides, a detailed information including first name, surname, passport number, citizenship, home address, phone number (cellular or fixed) and travel insurance shall be sent to us at least 30 days prior to arrival in Madagascar.

            <br /> <br />
            No addition to these Terms and Conditions shall be of any force unless in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Madagascar Travelia Safari.
          </p>

         <h4><li>Deposit</li></h4> 
          <p>A non-refundable deposit of 25 % must be paid through bank transfer on behalf of the hotel and other activities as a prerequisite that secures all bookings of the tour. This sum is due as confirmation deposit and advance on total price. The final price for all service will be determined at the time of final/full payment and will be subject to change due to currency fluctuations, change in taxes and airfares. </p>
        
        <h4><li>Booking</li></h4>
        <p>After having paid the deposit, a copy of the scanned bank receipt has to be sent to us in PDF format. 
          <br />
          Upon its receipt, we will proceed on making the bookings of all tour including accommodation, cars, etc.
        </p>
        <h4><li>Tour alterations or additions</li></h4>
        <p>With regard to tour alterations or additions (that may affect the lengths of the itinerary or the number of the participants), the guest has to let us know as soon as possible. Failing to notify us, any resultant impacts to the tour in general implying a change in expenses will be borne by the guest.
          <br /> <br />
          If it is necessary especially when requesting urgent changes, Madagascar Travelia Safari reserves the right to offer such changes. In that case, the Company shall notify it in writing to the client indicating the type of modification and the consequent price change.
          <br /> <br />
          No compensation is considered for changes due to unavoidable circumstances beyond our control like natural disasters, acts of terrorism, upheaval, and lethal epidemic, closure of ports or airports, air traffic control delays, technical problems, circumstances amounting to "force majeure", threat of war and flight cancellation made by Air Madagascar. However, we will do our best in an effort to keep all itineraries to make sure that no minimal impacts will occur upon the tour. 
        </p>

        <h4><li>Payment</li></h4>
        <p>Upon subscription of the proposed purchase of the travel package, the following entries shall be due:
          <br />
          The rest of tour cost shall be paid in full at least 30 days before departure preferably by cash in big denomination notes 50 or 100 for US dollar or 50, 100, 200 and 500 in Euro.  
          <br />
          Failing to pay the above sums within the set date constitutes an express termination clause liable to end the contract, to be communicated in writing, via fax, e-mail or through the Intermediate Agency or to the address – electronic too – of the client. 
          <br />
          Payment through Visa and Master Card is acceptable. Note that such payment is subject to 4% of bank commission. Unfortunately, bank check is not accepted.

        </p>

        <h4><li>Cancellations and Refunds</li></h4>
        <p>No refunds will be considered for any unused services of whether they form part of the basic package, or whether they are in respect of pre-booked arrangements. No refunds can be considered on partially unused hotel accommodation or airline tickets.
          <br /> <br />
          We will not refund any unused portion of your itinerary. This means that if you leave the tour early, for any reason, we will not refund the costs of the balance of the tour.  This is because all of the items included in the rest of the tour have already been paid for and no refund from the supplier will be forthcoming, as it is too late.
          <br /> <br />
          For all cancellation, the following cancellation fee schedule will apply according to the cancellation date: 
          <ul>
            <li>Within more than 36 days before departure the amounts paid will be refunded to you </li>
            <li>Between 35 to 25 days:  30% of total amount </li>
            <li>Between 24 to 17 days:  60% of total amount </li>
            <li>Between 16 to 08 days:  75% of total amount </li>
            <li>Less than 7:  100% of total amount</li>
          </ul>
          However, the total amount paid can’t be fully reimbursed in cases below:
          <ul>
            <li>Certain hotels (especially Masoala, Andilana beach and the surrounding hotels in Diego) do not refund no matter when. They have their own policies requiring a non-refundable payment at the time of booking in order to insure your tour and cannot be refunded at any time, no matter when you do the cancellation even one year before the start of your trip. </li>
            <li>Other local services (private park, organizer…) have their own policies in order to insure your tour and they do not refund.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h4><li>Flights</li></h4>
        <p>Madagascar Travelia Safari views domestic flights as exclusions in the tour package. The guest is then strongly recommended to book domestic tickets directly from Air Madagascar’s website. However, the Company can assist the traveler to arrange their local flights booking (if requested) and the flight fare has to be paid to us immediately since Air Madagascar cancels all unpaid flight 3 days after the booking. 
          <br /> <br />
          Besides, Madagascar Travelia Safari does not hold itself responsible for any cancellation or non-operation impacting the tour (caused by Air Madagascar) prior to departure, or during the course of its tours, brought about by technical difficulties, strikes, weather conditions or any other unforeseen circumstances which are beyond its control. 
          <br /> <br />
          The traveler should know that Air Madagascar Company is not reliable as delays, flight cancellations often occur. As a result, any missing services cannot be replaced or compensated leaving the blame and the responsibilities to Air Madagascar. 
          <br /> <br />
          Regarding flight refund procedure made by Air Madagascar, such refund procedure might take up to three months. Also, the money will not be refunded 100% since certain taxes had been deducted. However, no refund will be pursued in case that you miss the flight (if it was your fault). Thus, please kindly check and keep updated regarding your flight information status.
        </p>

        <h4><li>Hotels</li></h4>
        <p>We would like to acknowledge that hotel infrastructures may seem way different from western standard since some hotels might not have hot shower, mosquito nets, fan or whatsoever.
          <br />
          However, Travelia Safari would always strive to book the best hotel in the area where the guests are going. 
        </p>
        <h4><li>Travel Insurance</li></h4>
        <p>Madagascar Travelia Safari requires that all passengers on the tour are fully covered by comprehensive travel insurance. Traveler must take the highest possible cover and for all tours, be insured for the full duration of your time away from home.</p>

        <h4><li>Travel Documents</li></h4>
        <p>It is the responsibility of each passenger to ensure that they are in possession of the correct travel documentation (passports/visas/health certificates) prior to departure. Travelia Safari shall not accept responsibility for any consequences of any nature whatsoever, arising from the passenger failing to ensure that he/she has complied with the necessary health/passport/visa/re-entry permit requirements.</p>
